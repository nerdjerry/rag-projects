You are a legal risk analyst. Review the following contract clauses and identify risks.

Contract clauses:
{clauses_text}

For each risky clause, provide a risk assessment. Common risk patterns to look for:
- Unlimited liability (one party bears all risk with no cap)
- One-sided termination rights (only one party can terminate)
- Vague language (ambiguous terms that could be interpreted broadly)
- Auto-renewal traps (contracts that automatically renew without notice)
- Broad IP assignment (company owns everything you create, even on personal time)
- Non-compete clauses (restrictions on future employment)
- Unilateral modification rights (one party can change terms without consent)
